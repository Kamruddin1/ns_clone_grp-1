Greetings Sir/Madams my name is Anoop Yadav from team Mind Optimizer. Under the supervision of our mentor Sandeep Jha
sir we have Designed and developed our project which is Newton School Lite Website using HTML,CSS and Bootstrap
Framework. 
Need-Newton School Lite was developed to address the issues faced by users who were using Newton School on slow
internet connections and low-end devices. The regular Newton School website require high-speed internet and advanced
hardware capabilities, which are not available in many parts.Newton School Lite is a stripped-down version of the
Newton School Website, which requires less processing power and data to operate. The idea is to loads faster and
consume less data, making it more accessible to users with low-end devices and slow internet connections.
Additionally, Newton School Lite is optimized for low-end devices and operates smoothly on devices with limited
storage space.Furthermore, Newton School Lite was designed to cater to users in developing Areas, where internet
connectivity is often limited or unreliable. By providing a more lightweight and efficient version of the Newton
School Website.
In Summary Newton School Lite was needed because it provides a more accessible and efficient option for users in
areas with slow internet connections and low-end devices.
